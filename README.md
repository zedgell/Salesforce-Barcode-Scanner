A simple bar code scanner for Salesforce that lets users scan to add products and update products. Currently this is only being built for Android possibly IOS in the furture. Right Now in the Lattest Push the add items page works and checks to make sure there are no duplicates and that the user has had a successfull login. The login page works and lets users make sure that they can log in with those credentials before saving them locally. I look to add a page where users can update there products and a page where users can search for a products and see all the products they have in salesforce.
