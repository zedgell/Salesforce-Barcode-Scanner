A simple bar code scanner for Salesforce that lets users scan to add products and update products. Currently this is only being built for Android possibly IOS in the furture. Right now in the latest push the add items page works and checks to make sure there are no duplicates and that the user has had a successfull login. The login page works and lets users make sure that they can log in with those credentials before saving them locally. I have also added a Update Item page where users can search for items by barcode or name and update the product from the app.I hae also added a page where users can search for products and on the main page if your logged in there is a list view with all the product listed which was grabed through a asyc query.
